# node-sqlite-jumpstart

This is a small class I wrote for myself to get SQLite3 up and running faster in Node projects.

Features:

- APIs for common used default functionalities 
- Handle DB Migrations / Patches with backups
- Readonly and writeble DBs
- Typed

Examples of how to use the class are in the [test folder](https://github.com/phartenfeller/node-sqlite-jumpstart/tree/main/test).

**This is a pretty early stage project. Consider the API unstable!**
